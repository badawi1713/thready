# Getting started

Hi, this is my repository for React expert's submission by Dicoding, using Vite setup.

Let's get started with Thready:

- npm install
- npm run dev
- open http://localhost:5173

To test the app:

- npm run ci:test

I am also using some features from React Ecosystem like:

- [Storybook](https://github.com/storybookjs/storybook)
- [React-Hook-Form](https://react-hook-form.com/)
- [ShadcnUI](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs)
